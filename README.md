A snippet for inspecting font-family usage in a webpage.

## What's it for?

To have a quick look into `font-family` usage in a webpage.

Texts inside these elements will be ignored: `script`, `noscript`, `style`, `iframe`, `option`.

Invisible elements won't be taken into account as well, which are verified by any of the following criteria:

* with `opacity: 0`
* with `display: none`
* with `visibility: hidden`
* with `text-indent` value no larger than `-512` (an intuitive value) or the value equals to `100%` (which are common ways of hiding text for icons or title images)
* with computed area no larger than 1pxÂ² and with `overflow` value not equal to `visible` (which are common ways to provide accessibility enhancement, see GitHub's `a.accessibility-aid` at the begining of `body`)
* with `clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px)` (another way of hiding text)
* with invisible `parentNode` according to the criteria above

The result will sort all used `font-family` values by the number of glyphs they apply to. ie. most used one will be at the top of the result list.
